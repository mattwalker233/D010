Based on the provided division order document, I'll extract the requested information into the specified JSON format:

{
    "operator": "CONTINENTAL RESOURCES INC",
    "entity": "BLUE SKY MINERALS LP",
    "state": "OK",
    "effectiveDate": "06/10/2025",
    "wells": [
        {
            "propertyName": "PAYNE 1-10H",
            "propertyDescription": "SEC 10-T13N-R13W SPACING UNIT 640",
            "decimalInterest": "0.00822752",
            "county": "BLAINE"
        }
    ]
}

This extraction includes:
- The operator is clearly stated as Continental Resources Inc
- The entity/owner is Blue Sky Minerals LP
- The state is OK (Oklahoma)
- The effective date is explicitly stated as 06/10/2025
- One well is mentioned in the document:
  * Property Name: PAYNE 1-10H
  * Property Description includes the section, township, range, and spacing unit information
  * Decimal Interest is listed as 0.00822752
  * County is Blaine (extracted from "BLAINE COUNTY, OK")

The document appears to be a standard division order form with one well listed, repeated twice (likely for copy purposes), with additional informational pages about ownership changes and procedures.
