The undersigned severally and not jointly certifies it is the legal owner of the interest set out herein of all the oil, gas and
gas liquid hydrocarbons produced from the property described above payable by payor:
COMSTOCK OIL AND GAS, LP, 5300 TOWN AND COUNTRY BLVD., SUITE 500, FRISCO, TX 75034
THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT AMEND ANY LEASE OR OPERATING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE INTEREST OWNERS AND
THE LESSEE OR OPERATOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRACTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF OIL OR GAS.
The undersigned will be paid in accordance with the division of interests set out herein. The payor shall pay all
parties at the price agreed to by the operator for production to be sold pursuant to this Division Order.
From the effective date, payment is to be made monthly by payor's check, based on this division of interest, for
proceeds from production from the property listed above, less taxes required by law to be deducted and remitted by
payor as purchaser. Payments of less than $50 may be accrued before disbursement until the total amount equals $50 or
more, or until 12 months’ proceeds accumulate, whichever occurs first. Payee agrees to refund to payor any amounts
attributable to an interest or part of interest that payee does not own.
The owner agrees to indemnify and hold payor harmless from all liability resulting from payments made to the
Owner in accordance with such division of interest, including but not limited to attorney fees or judgments in connection
with any suit that affects the Owner's interest to which payor is made a party.
If a suit is filed that affects the interest of the Owner, written notice shall be given to payor by the Owner together
with a copy of the complaint or petition filed. In the event of a claim or dispute that affect title to the division of interest
credited herein, payor is authorized to withhold payments accruing to such interest, without interest unless otherwise
required by applicable statute, until the claim or dispute is settled.
Termination of this Agreement is effective on the first day of the month that begins after the 30th day after the
date written notice of termination is received by either party. The Owner agrees to notify payor in writing of any change
in the division of interest, including changes of interest contingent on payment of money or expiration of time. No change
of interest is binding on payor until the recorded copy of the instrument of change or documents satisfactory evidencing
such change are furnished to payor at the time the change occurs.
Any change of interest shall be made effective on the first day of the month following receipt of such notice by
payor. Any correspondence regarding this Agreement shall be furnished to the addresses listed unless otherwise advised
by either party. In addition to the legal rights provided by the terms and provisions of this division order, an Owner may
have certain statutory rights under the laws of this state.
