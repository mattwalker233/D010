I'll help extract information from this division order, but I notice the image appears to be partially distorted or contains overlapping text which makes some information difficult to read clearly. From what I can discern:

{
    "operator": "Unable to clearly determine from provided text",
    "entity": "Unable to clearly determine from provided text",
    "state": "Unable to clearly determine from provided text",
    "effectiveDate": "Unable to clearly determine from provided text",
    "wells": [
        {
            "propertyName": "Unable to clearly determine from provided text",
            "propertyDescription": "Unable to clearly determine from provided text",
            "decimalInterest": "Unable to clearly determine from provided text",
            "county": "Unable to clearly determine from provided text"
        }
    ]
}

I apologize, but the image appears to contain overlapping text or formatting issues that make it difficult to reliably extract the requested information. To provide accurate information, I would need:

1. A clearer version of the document
2. A version where the text is not overlapping
3. A document where the formatting is preserved and readable

Could you please provide a clearer version of the division order, or perhaps transcribe the relevant sections in text form? This would allow me to provide a more accurate and complete extraction of the information.
